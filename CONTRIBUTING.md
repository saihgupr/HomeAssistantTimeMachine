# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to help out! To keep things organized and make sure stable versions don't break, we use two main branches:

### Where should your code go?

*   **New Features:** Please target the **`develop`** branch. This is where we test everything before it goes live.
*   **Bug Fixes:** If it's a quick fix for the current version, **`main`** is fine. If it's for something currently in beta, use **`develop`**.
*   **Docs & Typos:** Either branch is totally fine.

**Tip:** When you open a Pull Request on GitHub, look for the "base" dropdown and switch it to `develop` if you're adding something new.

---

### Getting Started

1.  **Fork it:** Create your own copy of the repo.
2.  **Branch it:** Create a new branch starting from `develop`.
3.  **Code it:** Do your thing! Keep changes focused and clean.
4.  **PR it:** Send over a Pull Request targeting `develop`.

We'll take a look, test it out in the beta versions, and eventually merge it into `main` for the next stable release. 

### Not sure?
If you have a question or a cool idea but don't know where to start, just [open an issue](https://github.com/saihgupr/HomeAssistantTimeMachine/issues) and we can chat about it!
